title: "Learning the piano 'de novo'"
---

I googled "second time around" and the phrase "de novo" appeared. [According to the OED](https://oed.com/view/Entry/47599?redirectedFrom=de+novo#eid7498134) it means anew, afresh, over again from the beginning. Although I haven't completely forgotten how to play the piano (had piano lessons and reached Grade 5 at school) I realise now I used to play it a lot and not particulary do much practise to progress technically. 

During the ongoing palava of the delivery of the new piano, I dug the keyboard we'd been given ages back out of the back of the garage and spent a bit of time getting to grips with this while I waited for the real thing to arrive.

With the piano I brought back a book a neighbour had given me back when we got the first piano: [John Thompson's Adult Prepatory Piano Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/John-Thompsons-Adult-Preparatory-Piano/dp/071195433X).
