title: "A Roland FP-30"
---
## Sometime in 2019 (or maybe before)

Went to [PMT music shop in Old Street](https://www.pmtonline.co.uk/stores/london) to try out some electronic drum kits and digital pianos. The [Roland](https://www.roland.com/uk/) [FP-](https://www.roland.com/uk/products/fp_series/)[30](https://www.roland.com/uk/products/fp_series/fp-30/) stood out immediately as feeling “right” (i.e. like a piano) as well as being reasonably priced and well recommended.

## April 2020

Started the work to redecorate the back bedroom, a prerequisite of ordering the new piano.

## June / July

Noticed the FP-30 was out of stock in many places and worried at one point it had been discontinued. Suddenly I definitely wanted this model.

## Monday 17th August

Finally got round to calling PMT to check on likely availability and pre order the FP-30. Can't remember who I spoke to (Pete?) but he was chatty and friendly and said he'd see if he could get some info from Roland and call me back.

In the meantime called [Bonners Music](https://www.bonnersmusic.co.uk) in Eastbourne. Their website indicated they had stock or would have stock soon. Spoke to a rather grumpy guy who was rather satisfied to tell me they were out of stock and absolutely no idea when they would have any available. He obviously didn't want to sell me a piano, so decided not to pursue that.

PMT called back, they would have a delivery next week, but there was a waiting list and difficult to know how many people were on the list and how many pianos would be delivered. Chance I could get one in that delivery, but otherwise confident the September delivery would bring stock levels back to normal. I ordered the [bundle](https://www.pmtonline.co.uk/roland-fp-30-digital-home-piano-in-black-with-stand-pedals) including stand and pedals and paid the 10% deposit.

## Tuesday 25th August

Noticed on the PMT website that the FP-30 was marked back in stock. Phoned the next day to check if I'd been allocated one. They had received 21 pianos and I was either 21 or 22 on the list. He would call me back. Later that day, marked out of stock again and no phone call.

## Thursday 10th September

Call from PMT!! The piano had arrived - they'd ship it to me? I was reassured not to worry if it was delivered in two lots, just to double check exactly what I was signing for.

## Friday 11th September

Text from [DPD](https://www.dpd.co.uk) to say delivery in the morning. Only two of the three arrived initially. One had a bit of a hole in the side, I thought that one was the piano and opened the box to check no internal damage. Realised afterwards it was the stand. So pedals and stand delivered, but no piano. About 2pm I'm left wondering, well if it is two seperate deliveries why did I only get one text? Phoned PMT, they were a bit puzzled, checked with DPD, the other parcel was still at the warehouse. Initially I said I'd pick it up from PMT (due to drive down to Kent on Saturday anyway). "All this way?" slightly aghast. I thought, its not that far, but decided maybe delivery is easier. PMT said they'd arrange a free upgrade to a Saturday delivery and I rearranged plans so someone was in. 

## Saturday 12th September

Piano delivered about 13:30. I got back in the evening, box was in terrible condition, at least 3 labels had been attached and removed. Box had suffered from water damage and also had several holes in the sides. Contents was moving around inside. 

## Sunday 13th September

Drove up to London the next day to take it back (didn't want to subject that poor piano to DPD again). They said it had been at another store and then to their store hence a bit more wear and tear on the box. They said they'd also seen worse! Nevertheless they were more than happy to order a different one for me. Strictly I had 14 days to change my mind and return the stand and pedals if I decided I didn't want this at all, so in my mind, the deadline was 2 weeks Thursday.

## Wednesday 23rd September

Was about to call and cancel the piano, save the money and reorder in the new year when unbelievably PMT called ME - piano now available. I said I'd drive up the following day to pick it up!

## Thursday 24th September

Finished work, was checking the hours of operation of the congestion charge. WHAT. 7 days a week, finishing at 10PM. [Covid new rules](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2020/june/temporary-changes-to-the-congestion-charge-to-secure-safe-recovery). I was desperate not to leave the piano in the hands of DPD again, but thinking about parking outside the congestion zone and carrying the piano in the dark to the car seemed so silly when I could get it delivered. I called PMT, spoke to Simon, we contemplated delivery for Saturday but he said sometimes they weren't that reliable at the weekend. We decided Tuesday was the safest bet.

## Monday 28th September

No text message from DPD. Called PMT and spoke to Pete. The piano had a label on that I would pick it up. I explained about the congestion charge changes and had spoken to Simon re delivery instead on Tuesday. Too late to arrange for Tuesday now, arranged for Wednesday.

## Tuesday 29th September

Text from DPD early on, expect delivery tommorrow.

## Wednesday 30th September

Mr DPD arrived. Hurrah! One look at the box, sizeable hole right in the middle of the front of the box. It had fallen in the van onto another package. Delivery driver pushed his hand into the hole a bit, "the contents should be fine". I hestitated, this was such a crazy situation that they couldn't get the piano to me without it getting bashed around so much that the otherwise reasonably stout packaging was getting SO badly damaged. "You can refuse delivery." I'd already had to take one back, was this really happening? He was desperate to go and seemed to want me to refuse the delivery. So I did. I called PMT, described the situation, spoke to Simon, he sympathised. We agreed that whatever happened with the next one, somehow he'd manage to get it to my car so we didn't have to involve DPD. An hour later, he called back. They had stock at the warehouse, so I could pick it up the next day. We arranged that as long as I turned up reasonably late, I'd park just [outside the congestion charge area](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/congestion-charge-zone) and someone would help me / get on a [bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgbzQXtmVsA) with it down the road.

## Thursday 1st October

Long day, didn't feel like driving into London. At the last minute noticed a missed call from Simon, piano hadn't arrived, would phone tomorrow to confirm it was there then instead.

## Friday 2nd October

Simon called. Piano now available to pick up, they'd had to confirm receipt of the returned piano to the warehouse from DPD before they could release the other one. I said I'd drive in at the weekend. He said he wouldn't be there, but would leave a note for Jim and Pete, couldn't guarantee that there would be staff available to hop on the bus with the piano to wherever I'd parked the car! It was raining hard that day and the [forecast for the weekend](https://darksky.net/details/51.5247,-0.0939/2020-10-3/us12/en) was looking exactly the same.

## Saturday 3rd October

Miserable first thing, had pretty much decided to go into London on Sunday. However, it brightened up and was dry and sunny by lunchtime. Forecast didn't seem too bad and looked terrible for Sunday. Jumped into the car. Filled up at Sainsbury's then through the Blackwall Tunnel and into London along the A13. Snaked carefully around the congestion zone. Parked in Corsham Street. Still dry, but took the plastic sheet from the car just in case. Couldn't go into the shop due to too many customers already inside. The guy on the door brought it outside - no offer of help - "its not as heavy as it looks". And then "I heard you wanted a box without a hole in it" (wasn't quite sure if that was sarcastic or not). Carried it back to the car without too much difficulty and home. FINALLY!
